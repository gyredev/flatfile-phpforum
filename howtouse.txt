how to use


the blog directory is in : data/blog/

each blog post goes as the following:

(will print itself as raw file if file accessed directly.)

blog topics and user posts to that topic are all self contained in one file! On order for your native apache file ordering to work properly sorting newest and oldest topics, you must use the following format for files if uploading updates to your blog via ftp.
 
[4 digityear][2  digit month trailing zero][2 digit day trailing zero] [ space ] grey is a good color[.htm]
