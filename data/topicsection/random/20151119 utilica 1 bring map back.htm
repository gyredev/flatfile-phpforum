	I lost the map somehow. Utilica 1 would be better map to fix. Remember that one version it was pvp? maybe i can add pvp mode or some other kind of mode. I think you can put maps on a site and it autohosts them with bot from what i remember. I wanna make it so it not impossible on 2 player tho.

stupid halo 1 moment. i could&#39;ve gotten a killtac, but that one last guy ate like 3-4 shots from me and my aim was good too. i couldn&#39;t post this in the other thread and i remember i had an idea of 2 player utilica, but i never finished/started it.
